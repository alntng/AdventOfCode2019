# AdventOfCode2019

**From the AOC Website**

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

Every day from December 1st to Christmas Day there is a new Christmas theme problem that can be solved with code. This repo contains my solutions for the 2019 problems.

Files are named by day. Each day's problems can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019)
